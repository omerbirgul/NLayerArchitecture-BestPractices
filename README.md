# NLayerArchitecture-BestPractices

Welcome to the NLayerArchitecture-BestPractices repository! This project demonstrates best practices for implementing a multi-layered architecture in C#. The repository showcases a clean and maintainable architecture, making it easier to manage and scale large applications.

## Features

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility, improving code maintainability and readability.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes dependency injection to promote loose coupling between components.
- **Repository Pattern**: Implements the repository pattern to abstract data access logic and provide a flexible data access layer.
- **Unit of Work Pattern**: Utilizes the Unit of Work pattern to manage transactions and ensure consistency.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Uses DTOs to transfer data between layers without exposing domain models.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates data flow between the presentation layer and the data access layer.
- **Validation**: Implements validation logic to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Logging**: Includes logging mechanisms to track and debug application behavior.
- **Exception Handling**: Provides a centralized approach to handle exceptions and errors.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several layers, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **Repository Layer**: Contains data access implementations, including Entity Framework context and repositories. This layer is responsible for interacting with the database and providing data to the service layer.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates data flow between the API layer and the repository layer. This layer ensures that the application's business rules are enforced and data is processed correctly.
- **API Layer**: Exposes endpoints for client applications to interact with the system. This layer handles HTTP requests, performs input validation, and returns responses to the clients.
